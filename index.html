			<p class="intro">The Cross Bronx Expressway is infamous for the environmental
				havoc it has wreaked upon the residents that live near it due to the many
				FreshDirect food trucks as well as other delivery trucks that use the expressway.</p>

<p> The neighborhood of Mott Haven is so highly impacted by the pollution that it’s nicknamed ‘Asthma Alley’.
	An article by the Guardian reports that 97% of the residents in this neighborhood are Hispanic or Black.
	Christopher Tessum conducted a study for the National Academy of Sciences about
	the racial disparities of the pollution in Mott Haven and found that Black Americans
	‘are exposed to about 56% more pollution than is caused by their consumption and Hispanics 63% more’
	while non-hispanic whites breathe about 17% less air pollution than they cause.</p>
			<p> Even though the South Bronx is surrounded by rivers VICE reports that children who live
				there don’t get to experience those rivers and some don’t even know that there are
				rivers that are close to them. The multiple expressways intersecting through each other
				create a barrier for the children as well as increase their risks of health disparities.
				The urgency to fix this problem is higher now because of COVID-19. Since the novel virus attacks the
				respiratory system, people with pre-existing conditions are more at risk.
			</p>
			<p> Movements to increase greenspaces in cities are growing more so now than ever before.</p>

					<h4>Cross Bronx Expressway pollution</h4>

					<figcaption class="graphic-text"> NO2 forms from emissions from cars, trucks and buses, power plants, and off-road equipment. Breathing high concentrations of NO2 irritates airways in the human respiratory system and can induce asthma attacks
						as well as other respiratory desises. Higher levels of PM 2.5, fine particulate matter, are found most near highways and roadways. This matter can penetrate lunge tissue and cause respiratory and cardiovascular problems.

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">According to researchers at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health,
						a  park would add nearly two months of quality-adjusted life years (a combined measure of health and longevity) per person.
						This is because there would be less pollution and pedestrian accidents as well as a space to exercise and be around greenery. </figcaption>
